          What are 3rd party charges that are added to package prices?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Our charge is made up of two parts: (1) the fee for our service, which
          is £125.99 for the starter package and is equal to 1 day a month
          dedicated work on your marketing, £249.99 for the Standard package,
          which is equal to 2 day a month dedicated work on your digital
          marketing or £449.99 for the Deluxe package which is equivalent to 5
          full days a month or marketing. (2) The cost that we have to pay out
          to 3rd parties (such as Google or Facebook) for your digital
          marketing. For example example, if you want to get £50 a month’s worth
          of Pay-Per-Click marketing on Google Adwords, we will have to pay the
          Google that money to let us setup and launch your PPC campaign.
          Similarly, if you want email marketing using an email platform that
          has a charge to use their service/platform, we will pass that charge
          to you as 3rd party costs.

          How do I know when my contract will expire?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          When you commission our service, we will provide a contract for our
          work with you. The contract will state the start and end dates for our
          initial contract.
        </p>

        <h3 className="faq-container-h3">
          I would like to order more than 3 services. Is there a volume
          discount?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Yes, we provide volume discounts. We consider any order for 4 or more
          digital marketing services a volume order. Please call us to ask us
          about our discounts if you want to purchase more than 3 services.
        </p>

          Can I cancel my contract?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          We don’t hold you to long contracts that you cannot get out of. We
          also hate to see you go. If you cancel your contract within the first
          30 days, we will not charge you at all.
        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          If you wish to end the contract early (within the initial 4 month
          period), we will listen to you to find out your reasons. We aim to put
          right anything you may be unhappy with about our service right.
        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          If we cannot resolve the problem(s) to your satisfaction, you can end
          the contract. However, you will be required to pay 50% of the costs of
          the remainder of the package that you signed up for up to the end of
          the initial 4 month period – this is your contractual obligation
          period.
        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          You can end your contract with us on the end date – that is at the end
          of the initial 4 months period, and we will not charge you any more.
          Or if you are happy with our service, you can extend the contract on a
          rolling basis.
        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          After the initial 4 months period, you can end the contract whenever
          you want. We require a 14-day written notice period to end your
          contract with us.
        </p>

          How do I upgrade my service package?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Smallbiz-emarketing has 2 different packages available for purchase
          depending on your business needs. When needed, you can upgrade or
          downgrade to another package. Just contact us to tell us the new
          package you want. We will then produce a Digital Marketing Plan for

        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Once you agree the new plan we will start working to the new package
          at the start of the next calendar month and bill you accordingly.

          When do I have to pay for your service?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          The first month of our service is completely free. During this time we
          aim to have a full Consultation Meeting with you to discuss your
          business, marketing goals and digital marketing options. We will also
          develop a Digital Marketing plan for your business that will guide our
          activities.
        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Smallbiz-emarketing delivers marketing services based on monthly fees,
          which are taken in advance of services provided. Your first payment
          for the package and 3rd party costs is due 30 days after we start work
          on your account – from the Consultation Meeting. We will invoice you
          for the package and 3rd party costs every 30 days thereafter for our
          service until the end of our work with you.

          Can I get a receipt?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          After purchasing a package and making a payment, you will receive a
          confirmation email for the transaction. The email will display your
          company name, the package you have purchased, amount paid, payment
          details, and the transaction number.
        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          If you need a receipt and the confirmation email does not suffice, you
          can make an invoice request by emailing info@smallbiz-emarketing.com
          with Invoice Request as the subject line. To help us get the receipt
          to you faster, please provide the following information in support of
          your request:
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>A screenshot of your confirmation email</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          You will receive the receipt after the required information is
          provided within 48 hours.
        </p>

        <h3 className="faq-container-h3">Can I get a refund?</h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Refunds will be provided only for services that have not been started,
          subject to the 14 days notice of cancellation. Package costs are
          non-refundable for the current month for which they have been paid.
          You can cancel your package after month 4, giving 14 days notice prior
          to the next billing period. Costs of 3rd party services will be
          subject to their own refund policy.
        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Refunds will be returned by the means that they were paid. Online
          payments will be returned through the payment channel used by the
          client unless agreed otherwise.
        </p>

          Can I get a discount?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Yes, we have a Payback Scheme in which you are encouraged to share
          your order with your network. If any of your friends sign up for a
          digital marketing package and quote your Customer ID number, we will
          give you £5 off your monthly package costs every month until you
          cancel your contract with us.
        </p>

        <h3 className="faq-container-h3">
          Will you do everything listed in the service package every month?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          Analysis and reporting as well as recommendations to improve
          performance for each online marketing medium are carried out every
          month. However, it is unlikely that we will carry out all of the
          service elements in each package every month because our service
          packages cover everything to help your business get the best/fullest
          return on investment in each digital marketing medium.
        </p>
        <p className="faq__container-p">
          After agreeing to an overall digital marketing strategy for your
          business, we will propose and agree on the priorities to cover in the
          short and medium term. The priorities are then broken down into Action
          Plans for each month. We aim to cover all of the package activities
          over a period of months.

          Service Providers block messages from senders whose email addresses
