          "94% of small businesses do content marketing. 60% of business owners want to do more content marketing. Content marketing is the top marketing priority. Virtually all small businesses are already doing content marketing, while 60% of small business owners said they plan to increase their content production in 2015 (Search Engine Journal). Smart Insight’s 2015 marketing trends poll showed that content marketing is still the top marketing priority for 2015. With everyone producing content on the Internet, it is getting harder and harder to get people to see and pay attention to your information and resources. The reason everyone is investing in content marketing is because quality content sells. When you provide content that people love, they visit your website more often and stay longer, they will see your website as the place to go for answers to their questions, and they will share your content with their networks. You will become the trusted experts in your sector and the go-to business to buy from. In addition, producing useful content regularly and often will keep the search engines coming back to your website more frequently and at the same time, increase the number of things that your business can show up in the search results for. The more pages you rank high for, the higher your website will rank overall on search engines. Other websites are also more likely to link to your content, thereby increasing your reach, spreading the word about your business and exciting search engines even more. This is additional free advertising for your business that brings in more visitors and leads to more sales. More content does not necessarily mean better content – the emphasis should be on delivering sector-leading, high-quality content that is useful to your audience in that it solves a problem or answers questions they have. Is your content strategy working for your business? Do you know how to turn all that additional traffic into real customers? Almost all small business owners have so much to do, leaving little time to focus on creating great content regularly. The Content Marketing Institute’s 2014 research graph below shows the common barriers that stop small businesses from doing content marketing well. Let us take the strain and do the work for you."
