          "Consumers spend more than a quarter of their time exclusively on mobile’ ‘People spend 194 minutes a day on their Mobile devices, nearly twice the time they spend on desktops’ Mobile touches all parts of a business these days. Many people, including your prospects and customers, now access the Internet on mobile devices for searching, emails, accessing social networks, interacting with businesses, and making purchases. On average, people spend 194 minutes a day on their Mobile device(s) – smartphone and tablet – compared to 103 minutes a day on their desktops. Within a few years, most people will access the Internet through mobile devices. Successful businesses do not have a choice – you have to go where your prospects and customers are or you will miss out. Mobile is also a must-do for businesses because mobile technology touches on all parts of your digital marketing – your website, search, local, local and affiliate marketing. This entirely means that your business must ‘think and do’ mobile in everything to have any chance of succeeding. ‘More and more of your customers will be coming from mobile’ ‘This year, most sales in stores will be influenced by digital media’ The increased use of smartphones and tablets is one of the top factors driving the growth of e-commerce. Mobile has become a significant sales channel for online and traditional retailers as a greater proportion of customers are coming through mobile. Furthermore, more people are converting on Mobile and most of the customers that buy in-store will have been influenced by information they get on mobile devices (Forrester Research). When you connect with prospects and customers by giving them the functionality, information and processes at their fingertips at precisely the moment they are searching for your products or services, you have much more chance of getting that sale."

          "'Online sales on mobile will increase by 40%’, ‘40% of buyers say mobile is the most important media resource for a purchase’, ‘Up to 80% of smartphone or tablet users purchase after a search’, eMarketer rightly estimates that only a relatively small portion of retail sales, roughly 7.1% In 2015, will take place online because shoppers more often than not buy things in-store. Roughly half of smartphone shoppers buy anything on their phones. While digital is certainly not making physical stores obsolete, it is transforming physical stores into brand showcases where people go to look at the physical product. Mobile marketing increasingly influences in-store purchases every year though, serving as a catalyst for sales transactions that take place somewhere else. For considered purchases, people are researching online before and during their time in a store. 40% of consumers considered mobile their most important media resource for a purchase decision. An October 2014 Placecast survey conducted by the Harris Poll confirmed the multifaceted role of smartphones in shopping – far more consumers planned to use their phone to find a local retailer (39%), get social feedback on a potential buy (38%) or find a discount voucher (33%). Other consumer smartphone uses are to find price and product information, to check availability and the exact location of items in-store. Most mobile research leads to a purchase, just not on the smartphone, as shown by an xAd & Telmetrics 2015 survey, which found that 70% to 80% of smartphone or tablet users said they had completed or would soon complete a purchase related to their smartphone search. The new reality is that consumers are now shopping online to help them shop in-store and vice versa. This new behavior is changing the type of businesses have to take advantage of the fact that the purchase decision process increasingly flows through mobile devices."

        h1fourth={"Challenge of Mobile"}
        pfourth={
          "'Abandonment rate for mobile shopping carts is 97%’ ‘90 percent of transactions today are offline’ The barriers of going mobile have seen many businesses and marketers slow to adapt to our mobile world. As a result, most buying transactions (around 90%) take place offline (Forrester Research). These challenges include the costs for optimizing for the different mobile platforms, the relatively low conversion rates for mobile advertising, the difficulty in quantifying the impact of mobile in monetary terms, and adapting to frequent changes in the mobile landscape like Google’s algorithm update in April 2015. Forrester attributes the historical low conversion figures on mobile devices to businesses making it unnecessarily hard for shoppers to work through a purchasing decision from their mobile device as easily as they would through other mediums. On mobile, it can be challenging to view an item, navigate different webpages, or read through FAQ lists. Radware’s finding that nearly all mobile consumers (97%) abandon their shopping carts and do not complete transactions they have started, compared to 70—75% abandonment rates on desktop computers, especially because of slow page load speeds on mobile devices, clearly illustrates businesses’ failures on mobile. This has to change for mobile to work better for online businesses. ‘Mobile ad spending will grow 61 percent this year’ ‘Sophisticated and personalized marketing targets the right mobile audience’ Today, businesses and digital marketers are rushing to be mobile-first thanks to the advanced targeting solutions that have become available to provide streamlined solutions to get your message in front of the most relevant audiences. Magna Global and ZenithOptimedia predict that mobile marketing spending will grow 61 percent this year. Mobile marketing is the fastest growing digital marketing medium, growing five times as faster than desktop spending. Mobile spending makes up nearly a fifth of overall digital media spending. Mobile advertising is now more accessible as advertising marketplaces and new players enter the mobile space, addressing the challenges. This has enabled mobile marketers to develop a sophisticated and personalized marketing channel to better reach mobile consumers."
