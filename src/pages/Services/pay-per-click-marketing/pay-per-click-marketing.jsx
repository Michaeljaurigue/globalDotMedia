          "You will have seen that whenever you do a search on the Internet, there are adverts at the very top of the page, down the right-hand side, and at the bottom of the page. Businesses pay to get their brands on these adverts. Businesses in every sector spend substantial amounts of money to get their adverts on this valuable space on search results because it makes them money. Google continues to be able to make most of its services free because of its profits from businesses like yours spending hundreds, sometimes thousands, of pounds on paid advertising. The fact is PPC gets more customers and helps businesses make more profits. Most people think PPC is only good for getting clicks on adverts from paying customers. While you rightly want your adverts to get as many website visitors as possible, PPC has many other benefits even if they do not all buy from your website, including these: Get found easily – PPC ensures that people can find your business easily when they are searching for a specific product or service. Build brand awareness – From being completely unknown, consumers start associating your brand with their needs. More website visitors – Good PPC can bring your target customers to your business. They will see your products/services and the great value they can get by buying from you. This greatly increases your chances of selling to them. Soft conversions – Visitors to your website will not always make a purchase the first time for many different reasons. They may instead sign up for your newsletter, become followers of your social media pages, and/or download your app. This gives you the chance to nurture them and build a direct relationship with them that can lead to them making a purchase in the future. Optimizing conversion rates – website visitors that don't buy can leave a trail of information that should be analyzed to understand why. This provides valuable information to make improvements to your website and business."

          "We know from experience that it is relatively easy to get lots of clicks from visitors of whom, only a few actually buy. Indeed, research shows that roughly 2% to 4% of visitors make a purchase the first time they visit a website One of the many reasons this happens is because adverts may not be properly aimed at your target customers. The result is that you get visitors that are not actually interested in your products or services. Such visitors cost you money by clicking on your adverts and not making a purchase. Even worse, these visitors can give your PPC campaign a high Bounce Rate if they click out of your website on the first page they see. When this happens, Paid Search providers like Google Adwords charge you more for future adverts. No business wants too few sales and increased costs."

Choosing a workable structure for your campaign helps to stay organized and compare data to evaluate what is working and what needs to be improved. Choosing the right keywords ensures that your ads are shown to the right consumers searching for your product or service. Similarly, it is not always easy to ensure that your ads do not get shown for irrelevant keywords. Questions arise: Which keywords and negative keywords should you apply to your campaign? What is the right bidding strategy? How do you design ads that generate clicks? The wording of your ad plays a crucial role in whether potential customers click on your ad or opt for a competitor's.
