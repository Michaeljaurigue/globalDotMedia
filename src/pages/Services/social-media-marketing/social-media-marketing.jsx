          "As we live in an age where customers want instant responses to their issues with businesses, social networks are great for genuine two-way communication with customers that want more information and/or resolve issues. In this way, social media is a key resource for managing your reputation – If your business is not on social media networks, you will not know what people are saying about you and be able to respond appropriately speedily. Furthermore, potential customers have more trust in businesses that they see responding in a timely, sensitive and professional way on social media because it shows them that you care about your customers and deliver exceptional customer service.
