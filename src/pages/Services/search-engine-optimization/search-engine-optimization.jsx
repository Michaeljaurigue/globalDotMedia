Getting your website high up on the search engine results provides great visibility, ‘free’ advertising and reduces the amount of money you have to spend on paid search marketing. As you will see there are  a lot of things to get right to get a website optimised for search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo. While SEO can be challenging, it can be achieved by doing the right things and taking a systematic approach to implementing the necessary strategies."

          "‘93% of Internet users start on a search engine.’ ‘60% of people only click on the top 3 results.’ ‘Most people do not go past the first results page.’ Given that virtually all Internet users start on a search engine, you would be foolish not to give some focus on SEO. Furthermore, Internet users do not click outside the first page of search engine results. Also, businesses in the top 3 search engine results get more than 60% of clicks for every search. Put simply, a higher position on organic search results equals more clicks. ‘Website visitors from organic clicks are 8 times more likely to convert.’ Appearing high on organic search results clearly benefits the bottom line because Internet users trust companies based on organic searches than businesses in the paid ads positions (top side and bottom of results pages) – online consumers are more likely to click on the businesses in the organic results, and when they do so, they are 8 times more likely (than paid advert or social media visitors) to convert into paying customers. Put another way, more organic clicks equals more sales and more profits for your business. These reasons make SEO a must-do for all businesses. Do you know how to get on the first page of search engine results? Are you keeping ahead of the ever-evolving search engine algorithm changes? Yes, it is possible to get to the Number 1 result position on a search engine results page with hard work, time, and resources. Search EngineLand’s Periodic Table of SEO below shows the many behind-the-scenes elements that have to be right to have a positive impact on where a page ranks in organic search. Periodic Table of Search Engine Optimisation - Search Engineland. Anyone that promises to get your business to the Number 1 position overnight is being dishonest because that is simply not achievable. You will see that the top positions on almost all popular and frequently used keywords/search terms are dominated by big businesses that invest heavily in their marketing and have probably been doing so for many years. It is more realistic to take the approach that you can certainly rank highly on lesser-used search terms/keywords that your website is relevant to if you follow the right steps to optimize your website and content. In most cases, small businesses should realistically be satisfied with moving up the search rankings over time and seeking to rank very highly on the search terms that are particularly pertinent to your business. It is easy to get overloaded and confused with all of the steps involved in getting SEO right. With the hard work, the right resources, and time, we will get your business moving up organic search results pages by devising an SEO Strategy that outlines a step-by-step approach to implement your website’s on-page and off-page SEO techniques."

          "Keyword selection: You want your target customers to see your business when they are searching for your products and services. Using the most popular keywords may not guarantee high visibility. Conducting keyword research to identify other search terms your customers are using can help your business show up higher in search results. Website listing: Ensuring your website is correctly listed on search engines can significantly improve your visibility. Completing basic information such as page titles, title tags, and rich snippets properly can help search engines understand and index your website correctly, increasing your chances of ranking higher for relevant searches. Meta-descriptions with bite: A well-crafted meta-description can make a difference in whether a potential customer clicks on your link or chooses a competitor's. It should accurately describe the content and grab the visitor's attention. Linking social networks: Linking your website to social networks like Google+, YouTube, and LinkedIn can positively impact your search engine ranking, especially on Google. Engagement on social networks plays a key role as a traffic referrer. Building links: Having reputable websites link to yours indicates that your website is well-designed, liked, and offers valuable resources. Building relationships with quality authority websites can help you acquire inbound links and attract more visitors. PR: Press releases are an effective way to generate brand awareness and drive visitors to your website. Distributing press releases to digital publishers can provide exposure and increase awareness of your business. Profile Building: Having citations on relevant websites helps build your brand's online reputation, which search engines reward. Being present on relevant websites and engaging with other people's content demonstrates your knowledge and expertise in the industry. We can help you identify authority sites in your sector to build your reputation. Busy people, like small business owners/managers, often struggle to identify the authoritative websites to engage with. We can assist you in identifying authority sites for your sector to showcase your knowledge and expertise."
