      "p": "LinkedIn releases new tools for us to use often. As LinkedIn tends not to announce updates, you will not have seen these new tools and started to get the benefits in your LinkedIn marketing. Let’s dive into the new Linkedin Campaign Manager feature that rolled out a few weeks ago. Is this new LinkedIn feature a game changer for your LinkedIn marketing or just another shiny new object? How can you use the new Campaign Manager in your marketing and LinkedIn Lead Generation?",
      "h5": "About the new Campaign Manager",
      "p2": "I have just seen LinkedIn Campaign Manager for the first time today after weeks of waiting impatiently to see how it would look. I have already signed my clients’ LinkedIn accounts to my Campaign Manager, so I can tell you what it looks like, how it works, and what you can do with it. LinkedIn says: “We built Campaign Manager with you, our B2B customers, to help you maximise efficiencies, so you can create and execute engaging campaigns that cut through a crowded market with no added cost” ",
      "h6": "Accessing LinkedIn Campaign Manager",
      "p3": "You can’t access the Campaign Manager via your LinkedIn profile. Instead, you start LinkedIn Campaign Manager on a separate page altogether! You have to log in to your Campaign Manager link. You can access Campaign Manager as the ‘agency with multiple LinkedIn Company Pages or as a business that wants to give access to your agency. There are also different ways to approach the new LinkedIn Campaign Manager if you or your client have previously run LinkedIn Ads. Don’t worry if this is your first time looking at LinkedIn Ads. Getting your LinkedIn accounts on Campaign Manager is still relatively simple, as you will see below. Global.Media App Download banner For Clients with an Existing LinkedIn Ads Account To add a user to your ads account: Sign in to Campaign Manager. Click the correct account name. Near the top right of the account page, click the Settings icon next to the account name and select manage access from the dropdown. Click Edit on the top right. Click Add User to Account. You can paste in the member’s LinkedIn public profile URL (suggested) or type in the name of the member you would like to have added to your Campaign Manager account. When you give a member access to your ads account, you’ll need to assign them a role. If you have ever advertised or run sponsored posts on LinkedIn before, you will already have an Ad account on LinkedIn that you can assign to the new LinkedIn Campaign Manager. Otherwise, you will have to create an Ad account to start accessing Campaign Manager. Your Campaign Manager account is a place to manage your Linkedin Ads Account in one place instead of logging into several Linkedin accounts tediously. You can add users like marketers like Global.Media whom you want to give access to manage your LinkedIn Ads and sponsored posts for you.",
      "h7": "Granting someone page roles",
      "p4": "There is a menu box on the left-hand side of the Campaign Manager Screen. From there, you can choose Account Settings, then Manage access and then Add New User.",
      "h8": "User Roles and Functions in Campaign Manager",
      "p5": "When you give a LinkedIn user access to your LinkedIn Ads account, you’ll need to assign them a role and provide them access to your Company Page. Below are the definitions for each position: Account manager: This role gives users as full access to your LinkedIn Ads account as possible. The Account Manager can add and edit campaigns (status, bid, budget) and Ads (headline, image & copy). So the user can control Account Settings, access Billing Center, and download Account Reports. Campaign manager: The user can add and edit campaigns (status, bid, budget) and ads (headline, image & copy). Creative Manager: The user can add and edit your Linkedin Ads (headline, image & copy). Viewer: This is the lowest level of access you can give users as it only allows the person to view campaigns and Ads. They cannot make any changes. Billing Admin: You’ll need to assign a Billing Admin for each account. Admins can change billing details on the LinkedIn account, view your account billing history and print your payment receipts. You can learn more about user roles in LinkedIn Campaign Manager here. When you type the person’s LinkedIn account name (user email), they should appear in the search box, or you can choose the right person’s account from the list that pops up. Just one more click and the person you have given the role access to will appear in your account, like a team member, depending on the part you give them. I think I am pleased with any feature like LinkedIn Campaign Manager that gives me the ability to manage my clients’ LinkedIn accounts from one central location. If you work with more than one LinkedIn account, I guess you may also be happy to get an easier life? Let’s look more at Campaign Manager before you make up your mind.",
      "h9": "What can we make of the features?",
      "p6": "It is worth noting that the new Campaign Manager gives people access to your LinkedIn Company Page account to manage LinkedIn Ads and Sponsored Content only. Marketers like our clients and me will be happy that LinkedIn finally admits that someone can manage another LinkedIn user’s account – albeit the Company Page. It is certainly helpful to see and manage my clients’ accounts from one dashboard on my LinkedIn Campaign Manager instead of having to log in and out of each account individually. It is slightly annoying that adding someone to your new Campaign Manager does not mean they will appear on your LinkedIn profile. A previous LinkedIn update allowed you to grant people access to be Account Admins on your LinkedIn Company Page who can post and manage content and comments on your LinkedIn Company Page and export LinkedIn analytics reports. When a client assigns you as an Account Admin, their Company page will show up on your list of pages on your LinkedIn profile, just like all of the Company Pages you can access. I see the new Campaign Manager as a tacit admission by LinkedIn that there is no harm in allowing someone else to access and manage your LinkedIn account. Up until now, LinkedIn users had the fear that LinkedIn would sanction their account if someone on another location accessed the account. I remember several of my clients’ accounts getting flagged not long ago for that reason – LinkedIn got upset that someone had their login details and would advise them to change their passwords. Agencies like us at Global.Media often received a message telling us off for our wrongdoing with threats to be blocked or, worse, put in LinkedIn jail if we did not desist from login into other people’s accounts. And like ‘good little boys, we had to promise never to do it again. We just carried on as usual and ignored LinkedIn’s idle threats. Those issues are now behind us with the new Campaign Manager.",
      "h10": "Why should you care about the new LinkedIn Campaign Manager?",
      "p7": "Who doesn’t love new features on their favourite social media network? After all, we love new shiny things that they tell us will improve our experience and results on LinkedIn. Here are some reasons to be cautious about rejoicing that the new Campaign Manager will transform your LinkedIn marketing and lead generation. A centralised Business Manager is certainly not unique to LinkedIn. Google has always had a Business Manager managing Google My Business and Ads accounts. Meta introduced their Facebook Business Manager long ago to make managing different accounts easier without going through the client’s personal Facebook profile login. Arguably, LinkedIn is simply following the trend as always and is trying to maximise its advertising revenue by making it easier for us to increase our Ad spend (which is natural given that they are a business, after all). There is a case for saying that LinkedIn now focuses on Ads. I could be wrong, but time will tell. Making it easier to do LinkedIn Ads is further evidence that the organic features we have come to love and benefit from on LinkedIn (searching for, finding and connecting with your target audience) won’t work as well in future on FREE LinkedIn. I question whether LinkedIn is neglecting its primary function? LinkedIn is unrivalled when it provides a level playing field for us to connect with decision-makers in companies with whom we can do business. I see Linkedin ads on Facebook, Twitter, Google News and even on my newspaper app that sell how LinkedIn speeds the journey to reach decision-makers. So why not make it easier for us to connect with people in our target market organically? I can’t help but smell something rotten when LinkedIn rolls out Campaign Manager to get easier access to create and manage LinkedIn Ads while strangling the about to connect with your target audience. If you can use the new Campaign Manager to get more leads without blowing a fortune on LinkedIn Ads, I would love to hear from you because that excites me as a lead generation person! I certainly have no plans to start running LinkedIn Ads for Global.Media or for my clients because the cost per click of LinkedIn Ads is so damn expensive.",
      "h11": "Beware shiny new tools",
      "p8": "Very few ‘new’ tools and features online platforms roll out are innovative, unique, and never before seen. The functionalities often exist somewhere. So, you must answer whether a tool like Campaign Manager is something you must start using today? If all you’re doing is jumping on the LinkedIn new tools bandwagon because you see this latest development as a quick ‘hack’ to get your name in front of your connections and followers, then good luck. However, you can’t ignore that with most new platforms and features, new tools will likely be filled with hidden frailties, bugs, and UX design flaws at roll-out. We early adopters are essentially the guinea pigs for LinkedIn’s tests to find out what works, what’s not, and how to make their new tools work better. It is not until the second or third versions that any new feature/tool is fully workable and functional. Bringing it all together, I believe the new Campaign Manager can help marketers manage multiple LinkedIn Company Pages accounts more quickly if you run LinkedIn Ads to get prospects. So, you may find that you can get the best use out of LinkedIn Campaign Manager in the coming months or years. Like any new tool, I will always caution users to expect glitches and bugs that LinkedIn should be working to iron out.",

      "p": "Marketing is a well-tried and practised activity. As a consequence, most businesses are aware of the stages and tasks that you should complete to get the results for your business in terms of engagement and ultimately, more sales and revenue. The harsh reality is that no two marketing campaigns are the same and you can do the same right things in two separate marketing campaigns, whether that is in Facebook ads or even LinkedIn marketing, and get different results. Why do marketing campaigns fail to hit the mark even when you have followed all of the prescribed steps? I have learnt from my role of running a marketing agency and managing marketing and lead generation campaigns for hundreds of businesses that there is a secret ingredient that must be present for any marketing initiative to achieve maximum results. You may be finding it hard to get the results from your marketing campaigns, or maybe you are struggling to keep consistent with your marketing efforts? Read on to discover why the Law of Attraction (and action) is key to doing marketing effectively for any business regardless of whether you are managing the campaign by yourself or outsource it to a marketing agency. The components of marketing campaigns. Theory and stages in marketing. In theory, marketing your products and services should be straightforward. It is easy to see the logic in aiming to fill your marketing funnel by getting your marketing message (s) to a sufficiently high number of your target market of high-quality potential clients. Perhaps because marketing budgets are tight, some entrepreneurs underestimate just how many people your marketing message has to reach to generate the number of prospects that will enable you to achieve your sales and revenue targets. I have known clients come to us, saying that they want to pay for a ‘limited’ marketing initiative to get a fixed number of clicks or downloads. Their misguided belief is that they can convert all of the people who engage with their campaign into paying customers. Larry Kim tells us that across industries, the average landing page conversion rate was 2.35%. So in successful marketing campaigns, clients must be willing and able to invest in marketing activities that will reach a sufficiently high number of your target market. From the sufficient quantity of people who see your marketing message, a small proportion of those will take your call-to-action, and an even smaller proportion of those will be interested in forking out for your product or service.  For retailers, securing the transaction may be a simple task of providing a link to your products page. Whereas for businesses that offer professional and high-value services, a link is not likely to suffice. We know that the companies that take the time to speak with and get to know potential clients get more business on LinkedIn. The simple reason for this is that when you take the time to talk with prospects, you can better understand their circumstances and needs so that you can communicate how your service will solve their issue....",

      "p": "Every marketer has seen the statistics showing that email marketing is the number one marketing communication method with roughly £40 return for every pound you spend. At the same time, any marketer for small businesses knows those writers exaggerate email’s rates of returns because it feels virtually impossible to get most recipients to open your emails, much less take the action that you want them to take. Given that we all receive enough emails daily to clog up our inbox, we have to ask why the vast majority of businesses ’email campaigns fall woefully flat. I receive more than a hundred emails every day, and I have absolutely no interest in getting 90 per cent of them. My response is to delete them instantly. I am sure that I am not unique in finding myself on mailing lists about which I know nothing. For most people, those unwanted emails that sneak past the spam folders end up in the trash, meaning that most email campaigns have zero chance of working.  This post explores why recipients ignore and refuse to engage with the emails that businesses spend so much time and investment to create?

The Law Of Attraction states that positive thoughts attract positive events. Negative thoughts attract negative events. If you keep thinking and expecting success, and don’t allow doubts to enter your mind, you will eventually achieve success. When you apply the law of attraction, this power brings in your life the things you want. It is the law and power that brings into your life people that can help you with your plans. It is the power that can create the situations and circumstances you want. It is also the power that draws into your life the things you want and helps you achieve your dreams. It is the means to create the life you desire. At Global.Media we don’t believe that if you simply visualize, wish or dream about the outcome you want, it will happen as if by magic – no that could work in the long run if you get lucky. Although it is more likely that your wish will never become reality.

Marketers have come to see blogs as one of the most reliable marketing tools that bring a myriad of benefits that help businesses to engage existing clients and website visitors who may then go on to become clients. The fact is that with millions of blogs available to consumers, companies must invest significant resources to maintain their website blog and make it stand out. Every blogger is competing in a tough market to get people to see and spend time engaging with their blog content. The challenges of blogging see businesses swing between two extremes – some blindly believe that putting just a few hours into developing content for their blog will instantly lead to more sales at one end. Some other companies have been so beaten down by the process of managing their blog that they have lost all belief that the benefits of maintaining a blog are worthwhile. The reality of the need for blogging is somewhere between these two extremes. So what do you require to make your business blog work for you? Following the 15 steps that we will cover here will help businesses create high-quality blog content that gives you the chance to get the benefits.",

In truth, all bloggers are competing with millions of other businesses to get people to see and engage with your blogs. I know from experience that it is not easy to get people to act on your content. Many people will consume your content quietly so you could feel that you are wasting your time. Because of the benefits that you will discover in the next section, you should see blogging as a long term endeavour. Blogging pays off handsomely in the long run. So why bother blogging?",

Website pop-ups are a relatively new invention to the online marketplace as the technology (plugins and application) have become more affordable. Businesses often believe that they benefit from having these intrusive messages that aim to serve some purpose to engage more people. In reality, most people dislike the experience as we see pop-ups as akin to having marketing messages screamed at us. I have been on both sides of the fence – as a business owner who implemented onscreen messages and as an online user who is tortured many times every day by pop-ups that websites throw at me? Should a business install and deploy pop-ups, or will you be missing out?

A few clients (less than 10%) also have blog posts that we can share on their website. Our best clients understand that producing new content of their experiences on-the-fly massively helps our work. Sadly all too often, clients give us much less material than that with which to work. The harsh reality is that a business cannot just create content for social media as a one-off activity and expect that it will be sufficient forever. When you consider that we publish two a day, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for most clients, we require every client to provide content on an ongoing basis. Even though we source half of the content ourselves in the form of industry news articles, tips, quotes and video, our clients appear astonished by how much content a business requires for a consistent and engaging social media presence. New material provides essential benefits for your business, and when you stop producing it, it says something awful about your business to your community, potential clients and existing clients.",

            "p": "LinkedIn is a social network for finding and maintaining business contacts. LinkedIn boasts over 660 million users in more than 200 countries and territories. So you can bet that your ideal audience is on there. You just have to find them, connect with them and interact with them. That is easier said than done, however. LinkedIn is increasingly been recognized as the premier Business-to-business lead generation platform on the planet. With the right strategy, you will find the company of your dreams, whether you are looking for partners for collaboration, clients or employment. Unfortunately, for many LinkedIn … “does not work.” However, it is fixable! This post highlights five errors that lead to frustration as users struggle to get the outcomes they want from their LinkedIn marketing efforts. By the end of the post, you will know the big mistakes and how to avoid them in your LinkedIn marketing. Let’s dive into the mistakes: You have no purpose/objectives. You have a weak, incomplete profile or several identical profiles. You do not know how to use LinkedIn’s settings. You do not know how to look for people, vacancies, or companies. You are too salesy in your connection request and follow up messages. Let’s look at each mistake in detail and suggestions to get the results you want. You have no purpose/objectives It is a common joke (perhaps more of a fact) that if you are not on social networks, then you do not exist, and LinkedIn is a social network for professional connections and relationships. Being there as an active user does not mean that you are necessarily actively looking for work. Active LinkedIn users consciously approach others with a clear goal in mind. Most users have professional goals (both your personal and in the context of the company); you know what you are striving for and what results in you want to achieve before you start making connections on LinkedIn. Therefore, before creating a profile, formulate your professional and business goals, and separately write down what you need to achieve them. I am sure that on LinkedIn you will find some of the answers to this question by looking at other people’s profiles. Many people ignore the importance of specifying the target people they want to connect with on LinkedIn – ignore this at your peril. Being clear about your target audience is the prerequisite for your LinkedIn marketing because it sets the tone of your profile, the criteria you search for, your messaging and your interactions. You have a weak, incomplete profile or several identical profiles The goal is set. You know why you are on LinkedIn and what you want to do there. Therefore, it is time to clean up the profile. Any user who visits your LinkedIn page (and this may be a colleague, potential employer, future partner, or client) should understand who you are, what you can offer and how you can help them. To make your profile clear and structured, be sure to take the time to complete the main blocks. It will take you roughly an hour, but then you can always strengthen it and add new information over time. It happens that you might accidentally register twice with LinkedIn using different email addresses. Check it out and leave only one profile. Do not confuse yourself and other people. Adding a professional photo to your profile is a must. While it can be tempting to remain anonymous, the risk is that people you are asking to connect with you could doubt whether they can trust you and thus want to do business with you. After all, if you are hiding your identity, what else could you be hiding? If an anonymous participant views my profile, I do not have the opportunity to get to know this person; such a LinkedIn user will not have an optimized profile and thus is less likely to be found in search results. Therefore, I do not see any advantages of being invisible (anonymous) if you decide to be on LinkedIn. You do not know how to use all network settings Take the time and experiment with the settings to understand what works best for you. Therefore, you can turn off notification messages to e-mails if they distract you, or want to disable the “Display profile outside LinkedIn” option if this is part of your plans. Understanding the settings options will also enable you to understand some of the restrictions/permissions on other people’s profiles. You do not know how to look for people, vacancies or companies Most LinkedIn users are disappointed in finding key people or jobs, especially when they run out of profile limits. However, in the free version, there are many ways to find the person or vacancy that you need: through the search bar, through the news feed, through the functions 'People You Might Know' and 'Other Members Also Viewed' LinkedIn uses its search and ranking algorithms. So, if we enter the same search query, the search results with us can be displayed in different ways. This is partially determined by the profile, activity, and connections of the person. Put simply, you should be able to connect with people who are 3 steps removed from you (3rd level connections – these are friends/connections of friends – known as 2nd level connections of people you know or are connected with – 1st level connections. You are too salesy in your connection request message and follow-up messages Sending the right messages to your target audience is crucial to getting the response you want because they will better understand why you want to connect with them, and thus make a more informed choice as to whether to connect with you. Connection request message Your connection request message is often the first thing people see about you on LinkedIn. Failing to include a personalized message typically leads to recipients ignoring your connection request as they will be unsure of who you are or your motives. Briefly say why you want to connect with the person and who you are (name, role, business at least), then politely invite them to accept your connection request. Follow-up message Many people miss out on turning connections into professional relationships because they do not follow up with new connections. Think about how many connection requests you receive daily on LinkedIn. What do you do when you connect with someone and never hear anything back? Most people move on with their lives. Creating a follow-up message is the ideal opportunity to tell me who you are in more detail (compared to the brief connection request message), how you can help me and what you want me to do next. Messaging new connections is done through the Messaging tab. Some people use indirect methods such as offering new connections free stuff (diagnostics, ebooks or vouchers for example); others are more direct and invite you to a meeting or phone call. Personally, I want to meet my connections if at all possible. I will settle for a phone call or face time call if a meeting is impractical. Bear in mind that some people will want to know more about you before they accept your connection request or agree to build a relationship with you. So you must be prepared to engage in conversation with new connections on LinkedIn, through Direct Messaging. Bringing it all together LinkedIn is the most effective marketing strategy to connect with people in business. Making the right connections and building relationships requires doing the right things and avoiding the big pitfalls that can damage your LinkedIn marketing campaign. If you have the right LinkedIn strategy, you are literally going to turn on your tap to decision-makers in business anywhere in the world.",

It means you yourself determine your own success or failure. Moreover, if you think you can’t, this negative thinking will lead you towards failure. In other words, it will be a self-prophecy. I have met many people who are afraid to use the ‘cold messaging’ that LinkedIn Lead Generation offers to get connections and clients. The anxiety is particularly high when their target market is decision-makers in larger organisations or ‘notable business people’. While it is understandable to worry about whether prominent business people will engage with little old you, this post highlights the importance of having a positive mindset in your LinkedIn lead generation campaign as your psyche could make the difference between achieving your objectives to build the right relationships for your company or missing out on the fantastic potential that LinkedIn offers.",

The ability to leverage social media is not an inherent skill. Instead, it is something that we learn over time through trial and error. This blog post is aimed at those types of people.

                          "p": "The secret is out about the central role that LinkedIn plays in most marketers’ strategy to sell more these days. After all, LinkedIn has the highest concentration of professional people and businesses on one social media platform. What’s more, people on LinkedIn are open to considering products and services that can make a difference to them and their company. Getting clients on LinkedIn is not as easy as it sounds; however, because it is not a case of ‘login in and advertise your offerings to be a millionaire. There is a process that you can follow diligently to begin to see the difference in your lead generation and subsequently, the number of sales you achieve. Read on to discover why targeting is the one crucial ingredient to get the results you want from LinkedIn. You will also find out how to effectively find your target audience on the platform. Importance of targeting Targeting is the key to success in any marketing campaign regardless of the method. It can help to start with real people who are your best clients. A target market is a group of consumers identified as likely purchasers of a company’s product. They are your ideal customers as they are people who have bought from you or are more likely to buy from your company. These are the questions you need to answer long before you turn on the computer and log in to LinkedIn: With whom are you trying to connect? Who buys your products and services? What is their pain point and how does your business solve it? If you have the correct target, your message is likely to resonate with more with them straight away so that they take the action you want them to take. The opposite is the case if you are talking to the wrong people as they will not ‘get it’ or at best, you will have to be prepared to do a hard sell. LinkedIn makes targeting relatively simple because if you can break down the characteristics of your ideal clients into these three criteria, then you can find them on LinkedIn: What is their job title? In which industry do they work? Where are they based (geographical location)? LinkedIn offers many more criteria that you can use to narrow your search to the precise targets including company size (headcount), keywords, current business, previous jobs, group memberships, connections of, even revenue and many. Linked In’s precise targeting options in which you do not have to guess whether someone fits your idealclients based on interests or hobbies (as on with Facebook, for example), is what makes it the unique platform for targeted lead generation. Ultimately, LinkedIn is a Lead Generation tool that you can use to achieve your sales goals if you know how to use it correctly. Much like a person does not become a master builder by merely knowing that hammers and shovels exist, so it follows that few become effective LinkedIn marketers by being aware of the targeting capabilities. You must understand how to use the targeting to have any chance of reaching the right people. You also benefit from avoiding the common mistakes that many make when searching on LinkedIn, which we will now explore. Common targeting mistakes on LinkedIn Using the free version of LinkedIn is one of the pitfalls to beware of when it comes to using LinkedIn’ targeting. The simple reason is that the open LinkedIn platform Is severely limited in that it offers just nine search criteria that are curtailed in your options to find your target audience. For example, while you can find some major locations like Cities, you will struggle to localise your search to towns and smaller places. There is a good reason that LinkedIn regularly offers users the opportunity to take up their FREE month of LinkedIn Premium. With a subscription you can access Sales Navigator, which offers almost 30 search criteria including job title, seniority level and postcode, to name a few. Unlocking Sales Navigator is the key to Linked In’s secret treasure trove of potential clients. I can’t say that I am a fan of Linked In’s pricing strategy of only selling the Premium licences individually. As an agency, I would much prefer and would happily recommend all of LinkedIn marketing clients take up the subscription if there was a group or agency discount package. Another common mistake you will see people make when searching on LinkedIn is that they use one search term, usually the generic name or title for the criteria that they are want to find. In the real world, many people do what you do, yet they don’t all have the same job title do they? As you will see in the next section, understanding how to search for variations is crucial to getting potential clients on LinkedIn.",

More worrying, statistics show that companies with two negatives on the first page of search results risk losing 44% of its customers.

                                  "p": "Almost every business owner I speak with know say that they know they should be on LinkedIn. A conversation with a business contact recently helped me to understand the issue that makes many people reluctant to throw their marketing efforts and investment into LinkedIn. My friend, a LinkedIn user, told me in no uncertain terms that most of the people we both know through the business networking circuit ‘don’t get it’. That they are still asking: What is the point of wasting time on LinkedIn? What difference will it make to my business? This revelation is the driver for this post, as I firmly believe that LinkedIn offers a unique marketing strategy that no other social media marketing approach can give, hence the massively rewarding results that are available for companies. Read on to find out what makes LinkedIn a unique marketing approach, the LinkedIn advantage for business and how you too can get the full benefits for your business. Social media marketing Few will argue against the benefits of social media for business these days, although I still come across a few people every so often who challenge the boundaries of reason and reality. For those who ask, excellent visibility and reach to your target audience, mostly free of charge are the benefits of doing social media marketing. That said, we are competing for attention when we post to the noisy world of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and the other social channels. I accept that investing in ads drastically increases reach and visibility, especially to people who are likely to pay attention to your ads if you have got your targeting spot on. As we well know, people seeing your ads is one thing. It would be best if you had several other things to fall into place at the same time to have any chance of making a sale especially when it comes to selling high-value services. These include the desire to buy your product or service, the interested person seeing you as trustworthy and credible. The adage that people buy from people is perhaps the most crucial missing component when selling on social media – we do not often get the chance to build a relationship with those potential buyers on fast moving social platforms. When one or more of these components are missing, we typically get clicks, views and page visits with few conversions if any at all. The dilemma of having to spend even more on ads in remarketing to put the missing ingredient I over time then faces you. I am an evangelist about LinkedIn marketing because it is the only social media platform that offers the chance to navigate all of these issues quickly if you know how to use the platform properly. Advantages of LinkedIn Much is written about the fact that the majority of B2B marketers choose LinkedIn over other social media channels because they generate substantially more website visitors, prospects and high-value sales on LinkedIn. Despite the overwhelming testimonies and..."

The need for customers is crucial, and marketing plays a vital role in reaching out to prospects and converting them into clients. While the digital revolution has changed the marketing landscape, a mix of online and offline strategies is necessary to make a business well-known and credible to potential customers. Don't assume that everything before the Internet is obsolete. Tried and trusted methods like television advertising, radio advertising, print advertising, business networking, and direct mail still have their place.

While it may seem possible to handle all aspects of marketing yourself, it's often challenging to excel at everything. This blog post explores the signs that indicate the need to outsource your marketing and the benefits of working with a marketing agency. Small businesses face the strain of limited resources and the importance of marketing for growth. By outsourcing, you can access expertise, save time, and focus on core business activities. The right marketing agency can provide a range of techniques tailored to your business needs, create a detailed plan, and offer a dedicated point of contact for effective communication. Don't settle for mediocre marketing results, consider outsourcing to propel your business forward!"

Your Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn page can be your shop-front and is often the first thing potential customers see of your company. So unsurprisingly, we all want to give the best first impression that we can. In my role as a social media marketing consultant, clients who are intent on being copycats increasingly frustrate me. They appear to be missing the point of social media marketing and how to use it to build their brand. Instead of wanting to stand out from the competition, more and more businesses are falling into the trap of being the same as everyone else.\n\nI am writing this post to remind businesses that great marketing stands out. Confidence to carve out and follow your path online is often the solid foundation for getting engagement, sales and ultimately more business on social media. Let us see how being genuinely unique works.\n\nHerding sheep\nThe copycat mentality is far from unique to my clients as I recently found out in an article on MSN titled: This Instagram Account Shows How So Many Travel Photos Are Almost The same. The report showed what we all know, that many people are posting stock photos on their social media pages, mainly because they have seen that one or more other pages have got likes with them. The author insists that “the account isn’t here to shame people for taking like-minded photos, or to even shame influencers themselves. Instead, its purpose appears to be to get us all thinking a little more creatively”.\n\nSometimes, copying others is somewhat creepy and is nothing short of stealing.\n\nA recent report of an Instagram feed that has been plagiarised shows when being a copycat goes so far that it borders on insanity. This example of a copycat who has clearly gone over the top will shock you.\n\n“Linzi Cowan posted on Facebook with screenshots from the Instagram account ‘honeybasra18xo’, where almost every photo was an exact replica of one from her sister Chloe Cowan’s Instagram feed… the mystery user recreated poses, outfits and even captions from her sister Chloe. The stranger even went as far as to act out scenes from photographs of Chloe and her recently-deceased father”.\n\nThe fact that copycats exist on social media is not new. What is different for me is that I am getting more and more clients who want me to post ONLY stock photos on their social media feeds, something I object to because I believe it does more harm than good. I will explain the dangers in the following section.\n\nI almost feel sorry for those of my beloved clients when they ask me to look at a competitor’s social.."

Women typically arrive for a fitting shy, embarrassed and with less self-esteem due to bad experiences or frustration.

Colour can evoke different emotions and responses; for instance, blue can symbolize trust, while red can stimulate decision making. Faber Birren, a renowned colour theorist, explains the relationship between colours and emotional states in his book, Color Psychology and Color Theory. Visual perception is primary in formulating judgements, where 62-90% of judgements are based on colour. Different colours may signal 'approach' or 'avoid' responses. Hence, your brand's colour scheme should attract and invite customers. The familiarity and identity of a brand can also be enhanced by colour. Statistics reveal that colour significantly influences purchasing decisions, and the perception of a brand can be affected by different colours.",

        "p": "Optimising your tagline with keywords and phrases is very important to your LinkedIn profile. In your tagline, also known as your headline, use the keywords, descriptors and deliverables for which you want to be found for by potential clients, partners and investors. Do not let it default to your current job title. Instead, use this 120-character area to give the reader a snapshot of who you are and how you can help them achieve their business goals, motivating them to click on your profile link to read further. Buyers use these keywords to find people like you on LinkedIn! You can get direction for the keywords to use from descriptions that others in your industry use. Merely having a LinkedIn profile is just the start for getting clients on LinkedIn. You can get the attention of potential clients, customers, joint-venture partners, and influencers by treating your profile as an evolving organism. Successful entrepreneurs complete their profile correctly – your profile should reflect your experience and position, which should set you apart from jobseekers and others in your industry. Sharing your expertise through articles and resources is part of a complete LinkedIn profile. Similarly, your profile should be up to date so that people looking see recent activity and content from the last few weeks, not several years old outdated information.",

        "p": "Every company needs customers no matter the sector in which you are. In today's digital age, driving traffic to your business’ website is one of the primary methods businesses depend on getting visitors to become potential buyers who make an enquiry or deepen their relationship in some way (for example, newsletter signup). It is no secret that having a website alone is rarely enough to generate the steady stream of prospects we need to build a profitable business, let alone to achieve business growth ambitions. Read on to discover the challenges of growing a business organically, and why advertising is ultimately the answer to your traffic issues. You will also learn some of the more effective advertising channels that could help your business and some minefields to avoid. I was online in 1998 when there were fewer than 5,000 websites in the UK. In those early days of digital, a search on Google would show the 'big businesses' that dominated the sector at the top of the page. However, small players like ourselves had an excellent chance to be on the first page of search results, especially if we created good content. Visibility also was much easier to get for your brand online if you invested in search engine optimisation (SEO). Fast-forward to today, and there are 9.2 billion websites in existence. We can't all be on the first page of the ever-shrinking Google search engine results page that now has a large part of the real estate taken up by featured snippets box, search ads, the local pack and video options. In short, most websites have little to no chance to be seen by people looking for their products and services, even if they have fantastic content and the best SEO. Social media promises an enticing resource for companies to sidestep the search engine results conundrum as we can publicise our content and brands, build a large following and thereby generate a substantial volume of traffic to your website. Wait. Have you noticed that algorithms and active monetisation policies have skewed the promise of fair and transparent marketing platforms? The effect is that social media no longer gives us an equal chance to be seen by people who may be interested in your brand. With visibility of your organic posts on Facebook down to roughly 2 per cent of your followers, it is clear that organic social media marketing will also struggle to generate the numbers of visitors you require. What about creative alternatives like Community groups, WhatsApp and connecting on LinkedIn? My experience is that advertising on these platforms can provide more visibility without additional spending. However, none of them will give you the potential reach as Google’s millions of daily searchers or Facebook’s billions of regular users. Faced with the apparent glass ceiling on getting seen by a sufficient number of people to generate the volume of website visitors consistently to enable you to build a reliable sales machine, we must find another way to reach more people.",

            "p": "Are you doing enough to make your marketing work? Many businesses find that their marketing campaigns suddenly stop getting engagement from their target audience. These people may have lapped up your brand’s activities in the past by liking, sharing, commenting and even buying your products and services. Then suddenly, Nothing! When people stop responding to your marketing or no longer take the action you want in response to your marketing initiatives, your marketing has ‘stagnated’ – it is no longer working. Many companies are left bewildered and continue to struggle to embrace change to produce the results through online advertising to which they are familiar. Read on to find out why marketing stagnates and what can you do as a business to turn your leads tap back on. Why marketing stagnates As a marketing agency, we know what it feels like when previously effective marketing appears to stall. Moreover, many clients come to us because they struggle to get returns from often previously successful marketing activities. So you should not feel that it only happens to your company. There are many potential reasons for your stagnation, which we will next look at, and address. It is vital that you do not panic or worse still, fall into a cynical and despondent state because you can rescue the situation in most cases and get your marketing back producing returns for your business. These are some of the reasons marketing results stall. Content is no longer interesting, relevant or useful – people tend to like and engage with marketing campaigns from which they derive something useful. In many cases, the ‘thing’ people want and get is information that solves a problem or issue they have. Business’ typically create blogs, guides and downloads to provide useful information. When you change or stop sharing helpful content, it is no surprise that people switch off. You change the content from what your audience likes and enjoys. – I will use one of my favourite Instagramers to highlight the point about the drop-off in engagement when you change your content. Comedian De Beer shares fantastically funny jokes every day that makes me laugh out loud. I look forward to seeing his content and happily scroll down my news feed until I get the daily fix that I gladly share and on which I frequently comment. Like most of his engaged followers, I would be horrified if my favourite joker started posting about scientific research, business tips or pet advice, for example. Impressive though the new content may be, I would feel obliged to scroll past his posts if he stopped sharing ‘funnies’. People enjoy consistency in the marketing activities of the brands they follow. The following graph of sales time series data is a great tool to identify positive or negative variations that you have made in your campaign.",

As we head into our fifth year in business, now feels like a good time to review the year that has been to elicit some of the learning for us as a small start-up, lessons that we can use to strategise for the year ahead to provide even better marketing results for our clients. As you will find out much has happened in 12 months since my last review article and at the same time, a lot of the foundations of the business have stayed the same. Here is the low down that I hope will inspire and entertain as well as make you say, ”I know what you mean”. Let’s address the changes first, then the constants....",

Businesses have a vast range of marketing options from which to choose today, making it challenging to identify the right marketing strategy. A good grasp of the parts of effective marketing campaigns is the foundation for analysing what is not working in a marketing campaign. This knowledge urges you to adopt an experimental testing approach. Every marketing campaign can be broken down into four parts: Targeting, Message, Offer, and Hook. Understanding these four components can help unlock the return on investment for any business.",

              "p": "You’d have to be living in a bunker deep underground to have failed to realise that Facebook Ads is growing in popularity for businesses. Marketing on the social media platform is only going to increase because it looks easy to find clients using Facebook Ads. That is why 93% of marketers use Facebook to advertise. Anyone who has done Facebook ads knows that it is easy to spend a tonne of your hard-earned cash and not get the results you want or expect. I have been there, so I know how frustrating that feels especially as we see and read about others who have built their business on Facebook ads alone. This post is a guide to create compelling ads that will have people raving to buy from you or work with you? If you want to build your business by using Facebook Ads (even if you suck at them), then this blog is for you. I will tell share the strategies I use to get thousands of warm leads and customers for my clients (all small businesses). Every business needs a stable pipeline of prospective clients that are in the process of buying your products or service. Marketing and advertising is the way to not only find these ‘prospects’ (aka leads) but to also engage and nurture them until they are ready to buy. The average UK SME owner will be putting around 16% of their 2018/19 budget into marketing, according to a study by performance marketing network Affilinet. Furthermore, Social media (22%) came out on top of the list marketing elements that small business leaders will be looking to prioritise in the coming year. It follows that marketing is central to any business and most of us will try to take advantage of any glimmer of light that may make our lives easie, while bringing the results we want. Facebook advertising Facebook makes its profits in two main ways: by collecting as much data as possible from us and by controlling what we pay for access to that data. The figures tell the real story: Facebook has 1.1 billion daily users, so pretty much everyone from the grannies to business owners and their children is on Facebook. Added to that Facebook has built their business on collecting data from their users (us) that we willingly give them. They use the information to “personalise” the platform for companies who pay to advertise there. Facebook has become the go-to platform to target your ideal clients all in one place. It turns out that some of the information Facebook has been using to target ads has not been provided to the site at all, explicitly or otherwise. This has been dubbed “shadow information”, and includes contact details shared with the platform by another user, such as those provided for the “find friends” function (Marketing Tech). Digital rights campaigner Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has even called the social network “deceptive and invasive” as a result of how they use people’s data, sometimes without us knowing or without us giving consent. Whatever the ethical and moral arguments about Facebook’s data sources and practices, their detailed targeting information is precisely what makes Facebook ads so useful for small businesses – we can target the right people with the right message so that they are more likely to buy our product or service. Google vs Facebook Some may ask: isn’t Google Ads bigger than Facebook ads? The simple answer is ‘yes’. Google is a bigger advertising platform than Facebook because it generates higher ad revenues. Google’s $84.69bn ad revenue compared to Facebook’s $33.84bn revenue in the last year proves the fact. More importantly for businesses looking for the right advertising medium, Facebook ads and Google Ads are fundamentally different: Google is best for things that people are actively searching for hence it is best described as search marketing. Facebook is heaven for things that people may not know they are looking for. So it fits the concept of discovery marketing. Furthermore, Google search Ads are mostly text-based with around 30 characters available to describe your product or services whereas Facebook allows more words and most importantly, engaging photos and videos. For marketers, it is not a matter of which ads platform is better as they are distinctly different. However, there are predictions that within two years, Facebook and Google will be the only good advertising platforms worth spending your money on as a small business – unless you can afford the high costs of offline advertising on radio or television. Now that you are sold on the rationale for Facebook ads, let us look at what business do, where many go wrong and how to sell more...",

Priest got his start in affiliate marketing in early 2000’s where he cut his teeth building a few niche affiliate sites and eventually started managing company programs like Atomicpark.com and BuySeason sites BuyCostumes.com, CelebrateExpress and many others as a consultant. Priest has been an entrepreneur for over 15yrs starting different businesses (including one he sold) and recently in the past 4yrs started the affiliate management agency, Affiliate Mission that has been very successful (the fastest growing in North Carolina and maybe the South East of America). During that time he’s been committed to his family. He has 2 daughters, one son plays American football. His goal is to leave a legacy in the world so he gives back to charities and speaks to men inside the jails and prisons about leadership and beyond. Priest’s company mission is to help people break out of poverty, brokenness and despair. That is achieved by Affiliate Mission contributing a percentage of their quarterly profits to a non-profit of your choice; giving them the ability to leave a lasting impact on many lives.",

He also supports Scope and Barbados charities by donating items that have value instead of putting them in recycling centres.

Marketing should aim to effectively help your company to do the ‘know, like and trust’ thing that leads to doing business with you.

They do not believe marketing is getting the results they want or had planned. Here we address this thorny issue of ‘how to establish if a company’s marketing activities are worthwhile for your business’.
