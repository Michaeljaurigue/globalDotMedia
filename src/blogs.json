As an avid LinkedIn user, I have seen the professional network implement changes and updates that now actively deter users from using Linkedin’s features for exemplary marketing results. Furthermore, many LinkedIn accounts were thrown into LinkedIn jail during the May Bank Holiday for reasons that no one knows. In a constantly changing world, learning how to adapt and enjoy something better is to our advantage. This blog explores the significant changes on LinkedIn that threaten LinkedIn users’ potential to get clients from your LinkedIn connections.

      "p": "Marketing is a well-tried and practised activity. As a consequence, most businesses are aware of the stages and tasks that you should complete to get the results for your business in terms of engagement and ultimately, more sales and revenue. The harsh reality is that no two marketing campaigns are the same and you can do the same right things in two separate marketing campaigns, whether that is in Facebook ads or even LinkedIn marketing, and get different results. Why do marketing campaigns fail to hit the mark even when you have followed all of the prescribed steps? I have learnt from my role of running a marketing agency and managing marketing and lead generation campaigns for hundreds of businesses that there is a secret ingredient that must be present for any marketing initiative to achieve maximum results. You may be finding it hard to get the results from your marketing campaigns, or maybe you are struggling to keep consistent with your marketing efforts? Read on to discover why the Law of Attraction (and action) is key to doing marketing effectively for any business regardless of whether you are managing the campaign by yourself or outsource it to a marketing agency. The components of marketing campaigns. Theory and stages in marketing. In theory, marketing your products and services should be straightforward. It is easy to see the logic in aiming to fill your marketing funnel by getting your marketing message (s) to a sufficiently high number of your target market of high-quality potential clients. Perhaps because marketing budgets are tight, some entrepreneurs underestimate just how many people your marketing message has to reach to generate the number of prospects that will enable you to achieve your sales and revenue targets. I have known clients come to us, saying that they want to pay for a ‘limited’ marketing initiative to get a fixed number of clicks or downloads. Their misguided belief is that they can convert all of the people who engage with their campaign into paying customers. Larry Kim tells us that across industries, the average landing page conversion rate was 2.35%. So in successful marketing campaigns, clients must be willing and able to invest in marketing activities that will reach a sufficiently high number of your target market. From the sufficient quantity of people who see your marketing message, a small proportion of those will take your call-to-action, and an even smaller proportion of those will be interested in forking out for your product or service.  For retailers, securing the transaction may be a simple task of providing a link to your products page. Whereas for businesses that offer professional and high-value services, a link is not likely to suffice. We know that the companies that take the time to speak with and get to know potential clients get more business on LinkedIn. The simple reason for this is that when you take the time to talk with prospects, you can better understand their circumstances and needs so that you can communicate how your service will solve their issue....",

      "p": "Every marketer has seen the statistics showing that email marketing is the number one marketing communication method with roughly £40 return for every pound you spend. At the same time, any marketer for small businesses knows those writers exaggerate email’s rates of returns because it feels virtually impossible to get most recipients to open your emails, much less take the action that you want them to take. Given that we all receive enough emails daily to clog up our inbox, we have to ask why the vast majority of businesses ’email campaigns fall woefully flat. I receive more than a hundred emails every day, and I have absolutely no interest in getting 90 per cent of them. My response is to delete them instantly. I am sure that I am not unique in finding myself on mailing lists about which I know nothing. For most people, those unwanted emails that sneak past the spam folders end up in the trash, meaning that most email campaigns have zero chance of working.  This post explores why recipients ignore and refuse to engage with the emails that businesses spend so much time and investment to create? Read on to understand the principles of successful email marketing, recipients concerns and why you are not getting the returns from this otherwise highly effective marketing strategy.
